# RestoPicker
/Link to demo/

You're in a group, deciding on where to go to eat. Most people are polite
about their desires and defer to the group, so the one or two people with
the most outspoken opinions control the direction of the group. All well
and good for them, but perhaps those who defer would have been happier
elsewhere? How to make a choice without an extended debate while remaining polite?
Enter RestoPicker. This iOS app leverages the Yelp api and a weighted
choice algorithm to arrive at a choice of maximum happiness amongst local
options for your group of friends or coworkers with a minimum of fuss.
