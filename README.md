This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

### WebSockets

In order to ensure the smooth operation of the group experience, the app will use ActiveCable to connect the users via websockets. At each stage of the choosing process, data from the users will be collected and their status dynamically updated via their connection to the server, keeping each of their stores in alignment and ensuring that all will get access to the right forms at the right time and the same end result once all of the choices have been made and the sorting algorithm has been run.
